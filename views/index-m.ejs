                    <ul>
                        <li>Pressing spacebar before typing out the entire word</li>

                    <p>Learning to type with accuracy and efficiency will not only improve your work, but keep you more focused without having to look down constantly.

                    <p class="text-center">Words per Minute, or better known as WPM, is a unit of measurement relating to how fast a person can type. It is a simple calculation that takes the number of characters typed divided by 5, then dividing that by the number of minutes the test took place. A standard word is considered to have 5 characters in it. The average person typically scores anything between 30 and 40 WPM, with professionals scoring much higher. More information on WPM can be found <a href="https://www.keyhero.com/news6/">here</a>.</p>

                    <h2 >What words are used</h2>
                    <p >
                      All words featured in the typing test above are randomly generated on the server while the page loads. It pulls from an index of thousands of words, many of which are difficult to spell.
                      No two typing tests will feature the same words, you can always rely on this site to give you challenging typing tests.

                    <h2 >Proper technique</h2>
                    <p >
                      While typing it is important to keep your back straight and head up looking straight at the screen. Like walking, you can benefit greatly from good posture and adequate blood flow. Although this may be true, it is better to type whichever way is most comfortable for you.
                      There is no "correct" way to type.

                    <p >
                      Placement of fingers on keyboard can vastly improve the speed and accuracy of one's typing skills. It is standard to place fingers across the 'asdf' and 'jkl;' with your right and left hand. The F and J key will have a small piece of plastic below the letter and will help keep your index fingers always in the right spot.
