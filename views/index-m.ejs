                    <p>You have one minute to spell every word that appears on the screen. As soon as a single character is typed into the textbox, the test will start. As you type, check at the stats above to see how many words you have spelled correctly. Incorrect points are tallied when one of the following occurs: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pressing spacebar before typing out the entire word</li>
                        <li>Typing an incorrect character within a word</li>
                        <li>Leaving the input bar blank</li>

                    <h4>Benefits of Efficient Typing</h4>
                    <p>Learning to type with accuracy and efficiency will not only improve your work, but keep you more focused without having to look down constantly. Having to continuously look away from the screen can ruin one's train of thought. Making typing a skill that is almost second nature enables a person to perform their best work. Remember that like anything else in life, practice makes perfect.</p>

                    <p class="text-center">Words per Minute, or better known as WPM, is a unit of measurement relating to how fast a person can type. It is a simple calculation that takes the number of characters typed divided by 5, then dividing that by the number of minutes the test took place. A standard word is considered to have 5 characters in it. The average person typically scores anything between 30 and 40 WPM, with professionals scoring much higher. More information on WPM can be found <a href="https://www.keyhero.com/news6/">here</a>.</p>
